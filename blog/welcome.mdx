I'm Scot — a Data Scientist working in anti-fraud and a final-year Computer Science (AI) student at the University of Kent. On this blog I publish practical guides, code walkthroughs, and productivity tips to help other engineers and data practitioners solve real problems and move faster.

- TL;DR
  - What I do: Data science for anti-fraud; final-year CS (AI) student
  - What I write: tutorials, project write-ups, tooling guides (Obsidian, DataSpell, VS Code)
  - Who it's for: engineers, data scientists, and curious learners

{/* truncate */}

A few pieces of background:
- I currently work on anti-fraud models and pipelines, focusing on feature engineering and model interpretability.
- I study Computer Science with AI at the University of Kent — expect posts that bridge practical engineering and ML concepts.
- Tools I often use: [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), [DataSpell](https://www.jetbrains.com/dataspell/), and [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

If you want behind-the-scenes notes, I keep longer drafts and templates in my Obsidian vault — expect a post on how I use Obsidian soon.
