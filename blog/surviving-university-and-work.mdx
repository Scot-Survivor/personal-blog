Studying full time, while doing 24 hours of work a week across two jobs, and maintaining a social life is hard work, I hope by 
sharing my experience and tips I'll be able to help other hardworking students to do the same.

# Introduction
A huge reason for wanting to attend university in the first place was the social aspect of University, 
so when I started to pick up mutliple jobs during my final year, time got **busy**. 

A quick background, I was on a four year course at [University of Kent](https://kent.ac.uk), specifcally studying
computer science and artifical intelligence. This blog post focuses on my **final year of university**. While I was continuing
to work for my [placement year](https://www.kent.ac.uk/year-in-industry) company. 

I was working an average of 24 hours a week, 4 hours with university based jobs, and 20 hours at in corporate London. This, 
on top of a [Research Dissertation](https://www.kent.ac.uk/courses/modules/module/COMP6035) and one module a term **was a lot**. 
In order to handle the workload, and tasks I stuck to three core ideas, "Know your limits", "Gaurd your time" and "Compartmentalise".
These principle are all very simple at face value, but it took me a little while to realise how they would all work together.

# Know your limits {#know-your-limits}

You must be honest with yourself on the time you have, and what you can achieve, while there isn't a "most important" principle among the ones listed, 
this was one of the toughest lessons I had learn. 

Simply put, every one of us, has a *limit*, whether it be hours we can stay awake for, to how long we can hold a conversation, we all
in one way or another have a point where _"we just can't"_ anymore, if you're someone who has not yet discovered this limit, then 
you should give yourself a pat on your back. For the rest of us, when we're shuffling lots of tasks, and commitments it's important 
to consider how likely we are to be able to complete everything we have given ourselves to do on that particular day. 

If you're anything like me, then you likely keep a calendar relatively up to date, with "loosely" defined time slots for specific 
tasks, or commitments this is a tool from [Compartmentalise](#compartmentalise). This can work great to a certain extent, but what happens
when you have 3 or 4 deadlines all occuring on the same day? What if you phyiscally do not have enough time to do something? 

Well, as harsh as it is, there will be a time **you just cannot do something in the time you have**, and it is incredibly important that you are
honest with anyone relying on you, and more importantly **yourself** when this happens. If you are not, you could find yourself a victim of
[burnout](https://mentalhealth-uk.org/burnout/), and this can be difficult to "get over". 

# Guard your time {#guard-your-time}

<details>

<summary>Preventing Burnout should be your **highest priority**</summary>

Burnout is a finnicky problem, and something that you should be aware of when you're planning on pushing yourself. There is only so much
you can do, and if you try to break this limit too many times, you **will** burnout, missing a single deadline **will always be better** than burning out
and **missing them all**
</details>

The principle boils down to, once you know your limits, you know what you can and cannot achieve, similarly you should have an idea of the time
you have to complete a given task. By ensuring you pre-block your calendar / **make plans early** you are able to prevent (to the best of your ability)
the sudden changing or re-prioritisation of a task to the detriment of another. 

Similar to a many computational algorithms, you should have some "overhead" for the tasks you have, if you know a task will roughly take 2 hours,
add an extra half hour, if you know the delivery date is next week, aim for **a day or two prior to the due date**, you **must remain flexible**
Life changes quickly, and you have to be agile, it will lead to increased stressed, but knowing you have that buffer to play with **will minimise the costs**.
